## The OSI Model
#### Layer1 : Physical Layer
converts digital data to electrical or mechanical signals that can be transmitted over the network, and converts signals received orver the network to digital data.
#### Layer2: Data Link Layer
drives data transfer between adjacent nodes in a physical network.
#### Layer3: Network Layer
routes packets and performs flow control between two points on network
#### Layer4: Transport Layer
provides host-to-host communication, dicates the quality and reliability of data transmission
#### Layer5: Session Layer
initiates, maintains, and closes sessions between application processes
#### Layer6: Presentation Layer
Translates binary data into formats understandable by applications
#### Layer7: Application Layer
display data received from the network to users
